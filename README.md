In this repository, I have developed a comprehensive workflow designed to synchronize data between a NoSQL database and Google Sheets in real-time. The solution leverages Google Sheets App Script to facilitate automated and immediate updates, ensuring seamless data integration. The backend of the workflow is built with a Node.js web server and is hosted for testing and monitoring real-time data synchronization.

Key features include:
- **Bidirectional Real-Time Synchronization**: Ensures continuous and immediate data transfer from the NoSQL database to Google Sheets and vice versa.
- **Automated Updates**: Utilizes Google Sheets App Script to perform updates in real-time, maintaining data consistency.
- **Error Handling**: Incorporates mechanisms to manage and log errors during synchronization to ensure reliability.
- **Node.js Backend**: The synchronization logic is implemented using a Node.js web server, providing efficient API handling and communication between the NoSQL database and Google Sheets.
- **Hosted for Testing**: The Node.js server is hosted to allow seamless testing of data synchronization, providing real-time insights and performance monitoring.

This solution streamlines data management processes by providing up-to-date data synchronization between the database and Google Sheets, enhancing overall efficiency and ensuring reliable real-time data management.
